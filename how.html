                <h2>How it Works</h2>
                <p> As of now, our process has not been formalized as we are still working through what works best for our 
		    customers and our developers. This is an iterative process and each product that we build provides lessons 
		    learned that we can apply to the next time someone asks us for help. Our current process is described below, 
		    but we are working on migrating to something more structured so that our operations can scale better. </p>
